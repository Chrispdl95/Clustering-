# Clustering-

In this repo  we have implemented three different clustering techniques using
different values of the images.Based on the results , we observed that, for our
dataset using the values of the images produced by the encoder performed better
and quicker than using the pixel values of the images, with agglomerative
clustering performing sligtly better than MiniBatch.The use of the denoising
encoder didnt make a significant imporovement in the scores.
